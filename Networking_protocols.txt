TCP and UDP:

Both used to send data packets over the internet.
Both build on top of Internet Protocol.

Transmission way:

YOUR COMPUTER----------> ROUTER------------> DESTINATION

TCP: 

1. Secure--- no data is lost or corrupted during transit. Gaurantess that reciever gets packets in order by numbering them.
2. Full handshake --data packet sent--Recipient sends messages back it recieved the data packets-- delivers the data to sender


UDP:

1. Insecure--- data can be lost-- does not keep a track of data packets sent. No gaurantee that reciever is getting all packets.
2. No Full handshake -- Sender does not wait for reciever to reply back that it recieved data--sends data without any response from reciever.

That is why it is a bit faster than TCP but it is error prone. Ex: live broadcast, online games. 





SMTP:
